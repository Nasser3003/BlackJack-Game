Welcome to the Team Bill Blackjack game! 




## Basics

Blakjack, also known as twenty-one, is a popular card game played in casinos worldwide. The objective of the game is to beat the dealer by having a hand value closer to 21 without exceeding it. 

**Here are the basic rules of Blackjack:**

1. **Card Values:** Numbered cards (2 through 10) are worth their face value. Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are each worth 10 points. Aces can be worth either 1 point or 11 points, depending on which value benefits the player. 

2. **Dealing:** The game typically starts with the player receiving two cards face up, while the dealer receives one card face up and one card face down (the hole card).

3. **Player's turn:** The player has several options during their turn:
**Hit:** Take another card from the dealer. Players can hit as many times as they want until they decide to stand or exceed 21(bust).

**Stand:** Keep the current hand without taking any additional cards. 

**Split:** If the first two cards dealt are of the same rank, the player can splut them into two separate hands, each with its own bet. Additional cards are then dealt to each hand, and the player plays each hand independently. 

4. **Dealer's Turn:** Once the player has completed their turn, the dealer reveals the hole card and must hit until their hand reaches a total of 17 or higher. If the dealer busts, the player wins. If the dealer stands, the hand of the player is compared to the dealer's hand. If the player has a higher value than the dealer, they win. Ties result in a push, with the player's bet returned.

Blackjack is a game of both skill and chance, with strategies involving decisions based on the player's hand value, the dealer's visible card, and probability.
